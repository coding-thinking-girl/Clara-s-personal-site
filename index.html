      <h3>Hello.</h3>
      <p>I'm a 13 years old girl. I ðŸ’– learning new things, playing violin, going on the golf course, and programming.</p>

        <h4>Violin</h4>
        <p>
          I started loving music when I went singing as a little girl, with my
          mum at the Conservatory of Lausanne. Older, I decided to learn
          violin playing. I first studied at the Conservatory and after 5 years,
          I took a break with my mum doing other things, but guess what, I met some new
          professors and worked even harder. Now, I'm still learning
          violin and I still love it.

        <h4>Golf</h4>
        <p>
         I first dicovered Golf at a one week course. I liked it but I thought
         that it wasn't my thing. The year after that, I tried it again and
         fell in love with it. I've started training seriously, and passed my AIP
         test, but I still have a long way to go, so wish me good luckðŸ˜Š

        <h4>Programming</h4>
        <p>
         I went to an EPFL portes ouvertes in Lausanne with a good friend and immediately
         became a robotics fan. I started learning programming with lego mindstorms
         at the EPFL, and the robotics club at school. During the covid-19 confinement,
         my mum asked me "Why don't you learn how to program webs and apps?"
         And I was like "Yeah thats a good idea" So here I am learning to code, and
         trust me that I have so much fun.
